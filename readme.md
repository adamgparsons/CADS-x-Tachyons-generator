# CADS x Tachyon generator

This repo uses [Tachyons generator](https://github.com/tachyons-css/generator). The idea is to use the generator to create the foundation of a functional CSS framework.

## Usage

`start-generator`
This will use the settings in the config.json file to generate a tachyons styles css file and link to documentation.

## Additional notes

notes.md contains comparisons between the exsisting framework and tachyons.
